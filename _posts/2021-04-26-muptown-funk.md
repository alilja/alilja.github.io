It's always black outside my window. Growing up I was used to it being dark, but ever since I've been here, it's been black. Endlessly, always black. 

They give us shades for our windows. I asked someone at Starfleet why once, and she told me that they found better mental health outcomes for crewmembers with shades for missions longer than six months. "We think it helps people maintain a routine."

Every morning I open my shade and the light in my room changes from a low, dark orange to something that almost feels like sunlight, but outside the window is the same blackness that's always there. At the end of a shift, the lights pretend that it's sunset — maybe even the dead of night if I've been in the holodeck bar long enough — and I close the shade to block out the black.

Two days ago there was some sort of transporter accident. I've never actually used one before — I barely even left the ship before we got stranded out here — but after what we've been through I don't think I ever will. I'll spend the extra two hours in a shuttle if it means I don't have to worry about getting blended up with Petty Officer Anderson.

I guess things got bad. Turns out that if you get fused with someone else, you're not two people in one body, you're one new person. I got wondering, do you still have to take orders from your CO if he doesn't exist anymore? I kept writing reports, kept adjusting the resonance in the nacelles. I don't think anyone notices, but we're going to be out here for a long time. I want to make sure whoever takes my place finds these in great shape.

That day I forgot to open my shade. I came back to my quarters at the end of my shift and the shade was still closed. The light in my room told me the sun was just sinking behind the horizon. I stood there a long time as it got darker and darker, thinking about the black behind the shade. 

It was still closed in the morning. I could feel the blackness behind it, sucking the light out of the room. It was overcast, the room grey and flat. I left the shade closed.

The flux density was off in the November-12 chamber. It was easy enough to fix, but I had to draw a little extra power from the warp core. Last time that happened, Chief Engineer Torres chewed me out. Carey talked to me about it in the Mess later, which helped a little bit. But this time, no one noticed.

After I fixed it, I sat down to write my report. I keep them all in the same place on the ship's network. Just makes it a little easier for everyone if they're all in the same spot. There's a number at the top, tells you how many files are in the directory. One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven. I've written one thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven reports. I never wound up filing one for the problem in November-12.

My back was acting up again this week. Too much time hunched over the consoles, I guess. I kept thinking about my reports. One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven. I couldn't let go of that number; it kept cycling around my head. Had I done anything in my life one thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven times? 

The EMH was with another patient so I saw Kes. She gave me some muscle relaxants and a curt warning not to use them before a shift, then sent me on my way. I wanted to ask her how she was doing, but I kept to myself. 

One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven.

When I started filing reports, she wasn't even born. How many would there be when she died? How many would there be when I did?

My shade was open when I got back to my room. Did I open it? I must have. I couldn't remember doing it. I stared at the blackness outside. How many stars were out there? I thought about my reports, then closed the shade.

When I woke up, the lights stayed off. It must be the middle of the night, or whatever goes for that out here. I rolled over and saw the shade, that it wasn't quite closed. I could see the black behind it. I shut my eyes and rolled back over, but could feel it digging into my back. When the sunrise started, I was still awake.

I skipped breakfast. Anderson found me at my station and asked where I was. I shrugged and made up a story about going to the gym, then turned back to my work. One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven.

I went to the medbay to get a refill on my relaxants but two burly guys from security wouldn't let me in. I thought I heard screaming. When I got back to my room, the shade still wasn't closed all the way, and I found my relaxants on the floor next to it. The date said I just got them yesterday.

That night I couldn't sleep again, so I put in an extra shift. Someone I didn't recognize was sitting there, but they were happy to finish up early. There was a problem with the Bravo-8 nacelle. It was clear the engineer didn't have the same experience I did; his solution would have worked, but it was going to take all night.

When I finished, I opened up my reports. One thousand, six hundred and eight. Forty one new ones? I checked the author. They were mine. More than a month's worth of reports, documenting all kinds of minor issues and their simple fixes. 

My back kept me up. For once I didn't think about what was behind the shade, and I almost welcomed the pain. But I couldn't sleep, so I made my way down to the medbay. The EMH was chipper — well, as chipper as he ever was — and got me a refill on the relaxants. "I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to come back," he said as I left.

That morning, I woke up early, so I put in an extra shift. Someone I recognized was sitting there, but I couldn't remember her name. There was some problem with the October-17 chamber. She was working out a good solution to it, and we finished it up together. 

When we finished, I went to the console next door to write my report. One thousand, six hundred and fifty-two. I checked the author. They were all mine again. More than a month's worth of reports, detailing all the things I had done to keep things in working order.

I had trouble sleeping again. I told myself it was my back, but all I could think about was the black out there. I found myself alone in the Mess, something foul bubbling away in the kitchen. I sat in one of the easy chairs and drank replicated coffee that tasted like nothing.

When I got to engineering, someone was sitting at my console, so I sat down at the one next to them. One thousand, seven-hundred and eight. That night I had trouble sleeping. I kept my shade closed, but I could see the black leaking in. Tango-22 underfluxing. Simple fix. Simple report. One thousand, eight-hundred and two. Something was going on in the bridge. New captain. Old captain. One thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Two thousand and ten. Open the shade. Two thousand, one hundred and seventy-six. Close the shade. Juliet-6 density too high. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-nine. Open the shade. Close the shade. Open the shade. Close the shade. Open the shade.
