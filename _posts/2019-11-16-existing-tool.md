A large medical device manufacturer purchased a smaller company and wanted to incorporate their product line into their new software and hardware platform. This involved taking existing software running on very old hardware and updating it for a modern touchscreen interface. In order to do this correctly, we needed to understand the current limitations and problems and how well the old software solved them. As we learn more about what works and what does not, we update our design to better serve the end user's needs.

I am running a number of formative studies for fact-finding and prototype testing, presenting the results to the larger project team, designing UI prototypes, and working with the development and systems teams to work within organizational constraints to successfully integrate the product into the existing platform.
