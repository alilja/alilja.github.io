A large medical device manufacturer purchased a smaller company and wanted to incorporate their product line into their new software and hardware platform. This involved taking existing software running on very old hardware and updating it for a modern touchscreen interface and the new hardware â€” and in order to do this correctly, we needed to understand the current limitations and problems and how well our new tool solved them. I am running a number of formative studies for fact-finding and prototype testing, presented the results to the larger project team, argued for the best design, and compromised with design and development constraints to successfully integrate the product into the existing platform.
