If you can't explain it to a five-year-old, you don't really understand something. The acid test of this is technical writing, where one must clearly and effectively communicate how a system works to an audience with an [incredible range of proficiency and knowledge](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/computer-skill-levels/). I was brought in to write the system usage and implant instructions for a startup's new medical device. This involved explaining how the system worked for both clinicians and patients, and how to safely implant and maintain it.
