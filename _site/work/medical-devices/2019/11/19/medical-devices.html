    <p>Since 2015, I’ve been working in medical devices. This highly regulated industry requires a broad range of skills and activities for UX professionals, typically culminating in a submission document to the FDA and follow-up audits to defend claims and design decisions. It is essential that all UI decisions can be proven to reduce harm and make the system easier to use — any decision made without evidence is heavily scrutinized and may result in the regulatory bodies rejecting your product. All data must be recorded, all choices documented, and all UI designs rationalized.</p>

<p>Modern medical devices are incredibly powerful and complex — a pacemaker can tell the difference between a dangerous heart rate and the normal change in rate associated with exercise and respond accordingly, for example — but with these benefits come the risk of harm to both patients and clinician. An essential part of the design process is testing to ensure that the tools built are not only effective and easy to use, but easy to use <em>safely</em> and hard to cause harm with. This is done in two phases: first, the <em>formative</em> process, where the initial design is created, tested, and iterated on; second, the <em>summative</em>, where you do rigorous testing to demonstrate to a regulatory body (like the FDA in the USA or TUV in Europe) that your design is safe and all potential sources of harm have been minimized as much as possible.</p>

<p>I like to think of the two processes as <em>designing what the users need</em> and <em>proving to regulatory bodies you made it safe.</em> I have been extensively involved in both.</p>
