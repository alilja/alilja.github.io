    <p>A large medical device manufacturer provides a tool that allows patients to control their own therapy via a small hand-held controller. I was responsible for designing and testing the new touchscreen-based software on the replacement controller in the formative phase. The nature of the patient population required not just a highly specialized design, but uniquely rigorous testing to meet their wide range of needs. This took place in several sites in the United States and Europe with more than 50 patients over the course of two years, resulting in a final product that fits both the business and customer needs: a future-proofed platform that can be updated and allows patients to have necessary, extensive, and clinician-customizable control over their therapy.</p>

<p>After the design work was done, I needed to hand the project over to another employee. They needed to be brought up to speed about the steps the project had taken, why decisions had been made, and develop a deep enough understanding of the system and its design legacy that they could take it through validation testing. I worked with this employee to educate and train them on the product and create a document that could be passed to new employees to bring them up to speed quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>This project required collaboration between software developers, other designers, project managers, safety engineers, system engineers, management, legal, and regulatory â€” as well as cooperating with other human factor engineers working on projects that ours leveraged from, like hardware development or software design libraries.</p>
