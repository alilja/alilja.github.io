    <p>A large medical device manufacturer purchased a smaller company and wanted to incorporate their product line into their new software and hardware platform. This involved taking existing software running on very old hardware and updating it for a modern touchscreen interface. In order to do this correctly, we needed to understand the current limitations and problems and how well the old software solved them. As we learned more about what works and what does not, we updated our designs to better serve the end user’s needs.</p>

<p>In 2019, I ran a number of formative studies for fact-finding and prototype testing, presented the results to the larger project team, designed UI prototypes, and worked with the development and systems teams to work within organizational constraints to successfully integrate the product into the existing platform.</p>
