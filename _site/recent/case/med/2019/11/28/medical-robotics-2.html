Though the design and most of the interactions were already defined, I was responsible for ensuring that the prototypes worked correctly and robustly, identifying any issues in interaction design, and deploying them for formative testing.</p>

<p>The client was eager to make changes as testing went along, and occasionally I would be responsible for making changes to the prototype in the evening before one session, or even between morning and afternoon test sessions. This kind of short-term work required constant collaboration in the Gomoll team to make sure we were all on the same page and making the right choices.</p>

<p>The studies were executed through the latter half of 2019, and the product is expected to be released in 2020.</p>
