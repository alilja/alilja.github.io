Growing up I was used to it being dark, but ever since I’ve been here, it’s been black. Endlessly, always black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give us shades for our windows. I asked someone at Starfleet why once, and she told me that they found better mental health outcomes for crewmembers with shades for missions longer than six months. “We think it helps people maintain a routine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every morning I open my shade and the light in my room changes from a low, dark orange to something that almost feels like sunlight, but outside the window is the same blackness that’s always there. At the end of a shift, the lights pretend that it’s sunset — maybe even the dead of night if I’ve been in the holodeck bar long enough — and I close the shade to block out the black.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two days ago there was some sort of transporter accident. I’ve never actually used one before — I barely even left the ship before we got stranded out here — but after what we’ve been through I don’t think I ever will. I’ll spend the extra two hours in a shuttle if it means I don’t have to worry about getting blended up with Petty Officer Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess things got bad. Turns out that if you get fused with someone else, you’re not two people in one body, you’re one new person. I got wondering, do you still have to take orders from your CO if he doesn’t exist anymore? I kept writing reports, kept adjusting the resonance in the nacelles. I don’t think anyone notices, but we’re going to be out here for a long time. I want to make sure whoever takes my place finds these in great shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That day I forgot to open my shade. I came back to my quarters at the end of my shift and the shade was still closed. The light in my room told me the sun was just sinking behind the horizon. I stood there a long time as it got darker and darker, thinking about the black behind the shade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was still closed in the morning. I could feel the blackness behind it, sucking the light out of the room. It was overcast, the room grey and flat. I left the shade closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flux density was off in the November-12 chamber. It was easy enough to fix, but I had to draw a little extra power from the warp core. Last time that happened, Chief Engineer Torres chewed me out. Carey talked to me about it in the Mess later, which helped a little bit. But this time, no one noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I fixed it, I sat down to write my report. I keep them all in the same place on the ship’s network. Just makes it a little easier for everyone if they’re all in the same spot. There’s a number at the top, tells you how many files are in the directory. One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven. I’ve written one thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven reports. I never wound up filing one for the problem in November-12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My back was acting up again this week. Too much time hunched over the consoles, I guess. I kept thinking about my reports. One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven. I couldn’t let go of that number; it kept cycling around my head. Had I done anything in my life one thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven times?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMH was with another patient so I saw Kes. She gave me some muscle relaxants and a curt warning not to use them before a shift, then sent me on my way. I wanted to ask her how she was doing, but I kept to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started filing reports, she wasn’t even born. How many would there be when she died? How many would there be when I did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My shade was open when I got back to my room. Did I open it? I must have. I couldn’t remember doing it. I stared at the blackness outside. How many stars were out there? I thought about my reports, then closed the shade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up, the lights stayed off. It must be the middle of the night, or whatever goes for that out here. I rolled over and saw the shade, that it wasn’t quite closed. I could see the black behind it. I shut my eyes and rolled back over, but could feel it digging into my back. When the sunrise started, I was still awake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I skipped breakfast. Anderson found me at my station and asked where I was. I shrugged and made up a story about going to the gym, then turned back to my work. One thousand, five hundred and sixty-seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the medbay to get a refill on my relaxants but two burly guys from security wouldn’t let me in. I thought I heard screaming. When I got back to my room, the shade still wasn’t closed all the way, and I found my relaxants on the floor next to it. The date said I just got them yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I couldn’t sleep again, so I put in an extra shift. Someone I didn’t recognize was sitting there, but they were happy to finish up early. There was a problem with the Bravo-8 nacelle. It was clear the engineer didn’t have the same experience I did; his solution would have worked, but it was going to take all night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I finished, I opened up my reports. One thousand, six hundred and eight. Forty one new ones? I checked the author. They were mine. More than a month’s worth of reports, documenting all kinds of minor issues and their simple fixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My back kept me up. For once I didn’t think about what was behind the shade, and I almost welcomed the pain. But I couldn’t sleep, so I made my way down to the medbay. The EMH was chipper — well, as chipper as he ever was — and got me a refill on the relaxants. “I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to come back,” he said as I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning, I woke up early, so I put in an extra shift. Someone I recognized was sitting there, but I couldn’t remember her name. There was some problem with the October-17 chamber. She was working out a good solution to it, and we finished it up together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finished, I went to the console next door to write my report. One thousand, six hundred and fifty-two. I checked the author. They were all mine again. More than a month’s worth of reports, detailing all the things I had done to keep things in working order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had trouble sleeping again. I told myself it was my back, but all I could think about was the black out there. I found myself alone in the Mess, something foul bubbling away in the kitchen. I sat in one of the easy chairs and drank replicated coffee that tasted like nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to engineering, someone was sitting at my console, so I sat down at the one next to them. One thousand, seven-hundred and eight. That night I had trouble sleeping. I kept my shade closed, but I could see the black leaking in. Tango-22 underfluxing. Simple fix. Simple report. One thousand, eight-hundred and two. Something was going on in the bridge. New captain. Old captain. One thousand, nine hundred and eighty-six. Two thousand and ten. Open the shade. Two thousand, one hundred and seventy-six. Close the shade. Juliet-6 density too high. Two thousand, three hundred and twenty-nine. Open the shade. Close the shade. Open the shade. Close the shade. Open the shade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s always black outside my window.

This highly regulated industry involves a broad range of skills and activities for UX professionals from user interviews and research to all steps of the design process to communication with internal and external groups. Because medical devices are a highly regulated industry, every step in the process is documented — any decision made without evidence is heavily scrutinized and may result in the regulatory bodies rejecting your product. All data must be recorded, all choices documented, and all UI designs rationalized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern medical devices are incredibly powerful and complex — a pacemaker can tell the difference between a dangerous heart rate and the normal change in rate associated with exercise and respond accordingly, for example — and as a result no single person or team can be wholly responsible for developing one. Collaboration between groups within an organization is essential, and sometimes this means that groups with clear business cases — like software development — can get more recognition than the UX teams. Advocating for design and demonstrating its importance early in the development process is a critical responsibility for a human factors practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An essential part of the design process is testing to ensure that the tools built are not only effective and easy to use, but easy to use &lt;em&gt;safely&lt;/em&gt; and hard to cause harm with. This is done in two phases: first, the &lt;em&gt;formative&lt;/em&gt; process, where the initial design is created, tested, and iterated on; second, the &lt;em&gt;summative&lt;/em&gt;, where you do rigorous testing to demonstrate to a regulatory body (like the FDA in the USA or TUV in Europe) that your design is safe and all potential sources of harm have been minimized as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to think of the two processes as &lt;em&gt;building what users need&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;proving you made it safe.&lt;/em&gt; I have been extensively involved in both.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Since 2015, I’ve been working in medical devices.

The existing tool was no longer being manufactured, and the company wanted to move away from custom-made hardware towards more flexible, off-the-shelf devices like the iPad. The new programmer needed to work with all currently implanted devices, and be future-proofed to work with new devices with an unknown range of features and improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was brought onboard after the initial version was completed. My job was to develop, execute, and document the summative testing studies needed to prove to the FDA that the new programmer was a safe and effective replacement. The timeline for the project was highly accelerated, with six studies in 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing a summative study is challenging in both its rigor and its breadth. Features that have been defined as safety-critical need to be thoroughly tested in environments that are as close to real-world settings as possible. Poorly designed tasks can lead to bad data, an FDA rejection, and a development timeline set back by six months or more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed to do with each study was understand what features I was using. Without knowing how a feature worked, what it was used for, and what could commonly go wrong with it, I wouldn’t be capable of writing an effective task that actually measured a user’s ability to safely and correctly use that feature. I reached out to existing users of a range of skill levels to get a baseline understanding of how it was being used in the field&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:field_use&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:field_use&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and used that information to begin developing a protocol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each task required a unique, carefully-described success criteria. In order to work with as many users as we needed, studies were often carried out by multiple moderators at a time. This meant that the protocols had to be clear and usable by someone without my level of knowledge, and critically, that the moderator could correctly assess whether or not a user had correctly performed the task. This meant identifying what the intended outcome of a task should be and describing what it meant to accomplish that task safely — if the user had the right result but did it in an unsafe way, that was a failure of the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each study had concluded, the data needed to be analyzed and summarized into two forms: one in an official document submitted to the FDA, and one for internal usage about any usability or safety issues that needed to be fixed. In order to meet development timelines, I needed to analyze and summarize data from 30 to 45 participants in order to develop design recommendations. Sometimes, the turnaround on this process was as short as a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results of our studies were submitted to the FDA in phases, ensuring that if there were any rejections, the entire product would not have to be re-tested. All parts of the submissions I worked on were approved without issues or requests from the FDA. In early 2019, the new tool was competely approved for usage, sixth months ahead of schedule. That same year, I worked on formative studies preparing for the next round of validation testing to take place in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As we would learn, there could be a large gap between how a feature was used in the field and how it was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be used. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:field_use&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The client was eager to make changes as testing went along, and occasionally I would be responsible for making changes to the prototype in the evening before one session, or even between morning and afternoon test sessions. This kind of short-term work required constant collaboration in the Gomoll team to make sure we were all on the same page and making the right choices.&lt;/p&gt;

The company was replacing their outdated, custom hardware with off-the-shelf touchscreen devices, and needed all the functionality of their existing controller ported to their new touchscreen application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nature of the patient population required specialized design considerations to make up for physical and cognitive limitations. I designed and executed seven studies that took place in the United States and Europe, meeting with more than fifty patients over the course of two years. The studies were casual but rigorous — I wanted to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; the prototypes being used to find any problems, as well as listen to what users needed and what they liked or disliked. Success metrics could range from a simple task completion to something more complex like knowledge of a system state and how to use that information to make a correct decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After each study, my fellow UX teammates and I worked with the systems and software developers to figure out the best solution to our patients’ problems and what the right user interface would look like. I wrote presentations for the core development team to communicate general trends as well as specific results that were important to our users. These presentations were given to a cross-disciplinary core team. It was important that everyone working on the project understood not only what our users needed, but &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; so we could make good, user-focused choices together. This approach meant that when problems arose with proposed designs, the team could collaborate to find new solutions that met all the stakeholder’s needs. This collaborative approach led to a constantly-evolving application that met the user’s needs and worked within our own development constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UI designs began as wireframes and shifted into high-fidelity prototypes as key features were nailed down. Paper prototypes, click-through PDFs, InVision prototypes, affinity diagrams, and ranked choices were some of the methods I used to understand our users’ mental models of the system and where the problems in our designs were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My contract was completed at the end of the formative research studies, and I handed the project off to another UX engineer responsible for assembling documents for submission to the FDA. In mid-2019, the project was approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In 2015, I was brought onboard at a large medical device company to help them design their next-generation therapy controller used by patients.
