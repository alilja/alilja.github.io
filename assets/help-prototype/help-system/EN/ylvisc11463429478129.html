               <p>Before using the implantable device app, Medtronic recommends that you do the following:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>Read the implantable device instructions for use.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Read the device manager instructions for use.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>Carefully assess the patientâ€™s condition and the implantable device system to determine
                        the appropriate settings for tests and device programming.
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>Improper use of the implantable device app could result in erroneous programming,
                  inadvertent pacing, improper operation of telemetry, and incorrect operation of measurement
                  functions.

            </dt>
            <dd>
               <p>Due to the dynamic nature of the tablet environment, operating system events such
                  as notifications, alarms, and messaging can take priority and therefore move the implantable
                  device app to the background. Tapping, pressing buttons, and using gestures on the
                  tablet can also result in moving the implantable device app to the background or closing
                  the implantable device app. For example, the implantable device app moves to the background
                  if you lock the tablet.
               </p>
               <p>When the implantable device app moves to the background or closes, telemetry with
                  the implantable device is paused or lost, which results in the following scenarios:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <p>If detection has been suspended and there is no magnet present, the implantable device
                        resumes detection within a few seconds.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <p>If a test is in progress, the test stops or continues, depending on the type of test.
                        For more information, refer to the section on performing system tests in this help.
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
               <p>When you restore the implantable device app from the background, the implantable device
                  app attempts to re-establish communication with the implantable device and displays
                  the system status. If the implantable device app was closed, you must interrogate
                  the implantable device to re-establish communication with the implantable device.

               <p>If electromagnetic interference (EMI) occurs during a telemetry session, EMI can prevent
                  the proper programming or confirmation of values. For more information about EMI,
                  refer to the Medical Procedure and EMI Warnings, Precautions, and Guidance Manual
