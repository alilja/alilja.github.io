The VectorExpress LV Automated Test is only available with implanted devices that support a quadripolar (4-electrode) LV pacing lead. It is not available with implanted devices that support non-quadripolar (1-electrode or 2-electrode) LV pacing leads. Notes: The VectorExpress LV Automated Test is available if the permanently programmed pacing mode is DDD, DDDR, or VVIR. The default values provided by the VectorExpress LV Automated Test depend on the programmed values for pacing therapy. You can measure the LV thresholds with either the VectorExpress LV Automated Test or with the Pacing Threshold Test. You can also use either test to apply a safety margin to the threshold for the selected pacing polarity. If the implanted device supports a quadripolar (4-electrode) LV pacing lead, consider performing LV pacing threshold tests with the VectorExpress LV Automated Test instead of using the Pacing Threshold Test. The VectorExpress LV Automated Test allows you to automate the capture threshold and impedance testing of multiple LV pacing polarities.

Based on these measurements, the test provides optimized values for CRT parameters, including V. Pacing configuration, V-V Pace Delay, Paced AV, and Sensed AV. Test operation depends on the AdaptivCRT and V-V Pace Delay settings. If the AdaptivCRT parameter is programmed to an adaptive setting, and if the V-V Pace Delay is programmed to Auto, the CardioSync Optimization Test automatically programs the CRT parameters based on the test measurements. If the V-V Pace Delay is not programmed to Auto, the values resulting from the CardioSync Optimization Test for the V-V Pace Delay are set as pending values. The CardioSync Optimization Test automatically programs the remaining CRT parameters based on the test measurement. Notes: The CardioSync Optimization Test is available if the permanently programmed pacing mode is DDD or DDDR. The Pacing Lower Rate must be faster than the Sensing Lower Rate. The default value for the Sensing Lower Rate is 40 min –1, and the default value for the Pacing Lower Rate is 80 min –1. These default values are suitable for most patients.

	"title":"Operation of manual therapies",
	"content":"In general, each manual therapy with a corresponding automatic therapy operates the same as its automatic counterpart. Note: Manual ATP therapies deliver 1 sequence of the selected therapy. Defibrillation Manual defibrillation therapy charges the device capacitors and delivers a biphasic shock. If possible, the shock is synchronized to a sensed R-wave. The device does not confirm the presence of VF before delivering the shock. Ventricular cardioversion Manual ventricular cardioversion therapy charges the capacitors and attempts to synchronize the shock to a ventricular sensed event that is outside of the refractory period. If the device cannot synchronize the therapy, the device aborts the therapy. Atrial cardioversion Manual atrial cardioversion therapy charges the capacitors and attempts to synchronize the shock to a ventricular sensed event that is outside of the refractory period. If the ventricular interval is shorter than the selected R-R Interval, the device aborts the therapy. Atrial Burst+ pacing therapy Manual Atrial Burst+ pacing therapy delivers the selected number of initial atrial pulses, followed by up to 2 additional pulses in AOO mode. All the initial atrial pulses are delivered at the same pacing interval, which is determined as a percentage of the atrial tachycardia cycle length using the selected %AA Interval value. If the S1S2 option is selected, an additional atrial pulse is delivered at an interval determined using the selected percentage. If the S2S3 Dec option is also selected, another atrial pulse is delivered at an interval that is calculated by subtracting the selected decrement value from the previous interval. Atrial Ramp pacing therapy Manual Atrial Ramp pacing therapy delivers the selected number of pacing pulses to the atrium in AOO mode. The pacing interval for the first pulse of the Ramp sequence is determined as a percentage of the atrial tachycardia cycle length using the selected %AA Interval value. Each subsequent pulse in the sequence is delivered at progressively shorter intervals by subtracting the selected interval decrement ( Dec/Pulse ) from each pulse. Ventricular Ramp pacing therapy Manual Ventricular Ramp pacing therapy delivers the selected number of pacing pulses in VVI mode. The pacing interval for the first pulse of the Ramp sequence is determined as a percentage of the ventricular tachycardia cycle length using the selected %RR Interval value. Each subsequent pulse in the sequence is delivered at progressively shorter intervals by subtracting the selected interval decrement ( Dec/Pulse ) from each pulse. Ventricular Burst pacing therapy Manual Ventricular Burst pacing therapy delivers the selected number of pacing pulses in VOO mode. The pacing interval for the Burst sequence is determined as a percentage of the ventricular tachycardia cycle length using the selected %RR Interval value. The pulses within the sequence are delivered at the same pacing interval. Ventricular Ramp+ pacing therapy Manual Ventricular Ramp+ pacing therapy delivers the selected number of pacing pulses in VOO mode. The pacing interval for the first pulse of the Ramp+ sequence is determined as a percentage of the ventricular tachycardia cycle length using the selected R-S1(%RR) value. The second pulse is delivered at an interval determined using the selected S1S2(%RR) percentage. Any remaining pulses in the sequence are delivered at the selected S2SN(%RR) percentage.",

	"content":"You can use the Wavelet Test to create a template manually if a template does not exist or if the existing template no longer matches the patient’s intrinsic QRS morphology. Certain factors, such as a change in the patient’s medication or disease progression, may have affected the appropriateness of the currently stored template. After you successfully create a template, the template goes into effect immediately and does not go through a confirmation process. Notes: There must be a sufficient number of intrinsic events that occur during the template creation process in order to create a template. You may need to adjust the Lower Rate or the Mode to promote intrinsic events. If no intrinsic events occur and you make no changes to the Lower Rate, the test ends automatically after several seconds and restores the programmed settings. Ensure that the EGM 2 Range closely matches the amplitude of the patient’s EGM signals so that a template can be created. If the EGM signal exceeds the programmed EGM 2 Range, you can increase the EGM 2 Range to prevent clipping of the signal. If the EGM signal occupies only a small fraction of the EGM amplitude range, decrease the EGM 2 Range so that the signal uses a larger portion of the range. You can access the EGM 2 Range by tapping ADJUST PERMANENT. After adjusting the EGM 2 Range, you must create a new template. Tachyarrhythmia detection is suspended when you tap CREATE Template.

During the test, intrinsic QRS waveforms are assigned match scores (percentages) in the Live Rhythm Monitor area. The higher the percentage, the closer the template event matches the patient’s intrinsic event. Waveforms that fall below the programmable Match Threshold value are determined to be non-match events. To increase the likelihood that sensed events will occur during the test, you can select temporary pacing settings that evoke the patient’s intrinsic rhythm. Notes: Reduce the pacing rate gradually to minimize symptoms associated with abrupt changes in heart rate. Changes to the Match Threshold value can adversely affect Wavelet operation. For information about Wavelet and the impact of increasing or decreasing the Match Threshold value, see the reference manual for the implanted device. You cannot perform the Wavelet Test if the programmed pacing mode is AOO, VOO, or DOO because sensing is turned off in these modes.

Configure the following options. Note: Data collection is automatic and you cannot turn it off. Option Description LECG SOURCE Allows you to select the source for the Leadless ECG (LECG) waveform that appears on the LECG channel. Leadless ECG is an approximation of a surface ECG signal through the Can to SVC source and is available only when an SVC coil is present. You can also choose to display the waveform from the RVcoil to Aring source or the Can to Aring source on the LECG channel. EGM SOURCE For each EGM channel, allows you to select the source electrodes that the implantable device uses to record EGM signals. The EGM SOURCE parameters control the signal that appears on the Live Rhythm Monitor. Note: The cardiac interval measurements of the implantable device are based on the signals sensed through the programmed sensing polarity (not the stored diagnostic EGM). Your EGM source selection does not affect tachyarrhythmia interval criteria, synchronization, or therapy. LECG RANGE and EGM RANGE Allows you to select the range for the LECG channel and for each EGM channel. The range affects the resolution of the EGM signal. The lower the setting, the higher the resolution. When the signal is illegible or clipped, change the range selection. The LECG RANGE and EGM RANGE parameters control the signal that appears on the Live Rhythm Monitor. Monitored Allows you to select the 2 channels on which to store episode records. Pre-arrhythmia EGM Allows you to choose if you want to store the EGM data that the implantable device collects before an episode begins. When the device is set to nominal parameters, it provides continuous pre-arrhythmia EGM storage with minimal longevity impact. If the parameters for EGM storage or Sense Polarity are changed, the device may be required to keep additional EGM circuitry enabled at all times, which reduces device longevity. Refer to the reference manual for the implanted device for more information about the operation of pre-arrhythmia EGM storage. For single-chamber devices only: When you select On − 1 months or On − 3 months, the implantable device automatically turns off pre-arrhythmia EGM storage when the time period expires.

	"title":"Perform a Sensing Test",
	"content":"To assess lead integrity and sensing performance, perform the Sensing Test, which measures P-wave and R-wave amplitudes. The Sensing Test allows you to temporarily program pacing parameters to increase the likelihood that sensed events will occur. Sensing amplitude measurements taken during a Sensing Test may include events that are atypical or a result of oversensing (for example, PVCs or far-field R-waves). These events are excluded from the daily automatic sensing amplitude measurements that the implanted device collects and reports in the sensing amplitude trends. Because of the difference in measurement operations, Sensing Test results can differ from the measurements reported in the sensing amplitude trend data. Caution: Use caution when selecting temporary settings for pacemaker-dependent patients. These patients may not receive adequate pacing support while sensing amplitude measurements are being obtained. Notes: The Sensing Test does not function when the device is operating in an asynchronous pacing mode, such as VOO. Program the device to a pacing mode other than an asynchronous pacing mode before performing a Sensing Test. The Sensing Test does not function when polarity parameters are set to Configure. Program polarity parameter values manually or allow implant detection to complete before performing a Sensing Test. The ventricular sensing electrodes included in Sensing Test measurements depend on the programmed RV Sense Polarity value. During a Sensing Test, reduce the pacing rate gradually to minimize patient symptoms associated with abrupt changes in heart rate. If telemetry between the implantable device app and the implanted device is paused or lost during a Sensing Test, the test stops and the implanted device parameters revert to permanently programmed values. During system tests, tachyarrhythmia detection is suspended. Tap, then tap TESTS &gt; SENSING. Verify or change the TEST VALUE parameter values for Mode and AV Delay. Note: The pacing modes available under TEST VALUE depend on the programmed pacing mode. Tap START Measurement. Observe the Live Rhythm Monitor for an intrinsic rhythm. If consistent pacing continues to occur, tap to decrease the Lower Rate. The implanted device measures amplitudes only for intrinsic events. The maximum amplitude value that the Sensing Test measures is 20 mV. When the amplitude measures over 20 mV, the implantable device app displays the results as &gt;20 mV. When there are no intrinsic events and the pacing rate remains the same, the Sensing Test automatically stops. When the Sensing Test successfully completes, it automatically stops. The implantable device app displays the measurements and the pacing settings return to their programmed values. To stop the test manually before it completes, tap STOP and Restore.

Note: For warnings and precautions about the use of the implantable devices that are compatible with the implantable device app, refer to the device manual. Electrical and patient safety The device manager is compliant with the requirements of IEC 60601-1 for electrical and patient safety. Importance of instructions for use Before using the implantable device app, Medtronic recommends that you do the following: Read the implantable device instructions for use. Read the device manager instructions for use. Carefully assess the patient’s condition and the implantable device system to determine the appropriate settings for tests and device programming. Improper use of the implantable device app could result in erroneous programming, inadvertent pacing, improper operation of telemetry, and incorrect operation of measurement functions. Tablet and app interaction Due to the dynamic nature of the tablet environment, operating system events such as notifications, alarms, and messaging can take priority and therefore move the implantable device app to the background. Tapping, pressing buttons, and using gestures on the tablet can also result in moving the implantable device app to the background or closing the implantable device app. For example, the implantable device app moves to the background if you lock the tablet. When the implantable device app moves to the background or closes, telemetry with the implantable device is paused or lost, which results in the following scenarios: If detection has been suspended and there is no magnet present, the implantable device resumes detection within a few seconds. If a test is in progress, the test stops or continues, depending on the type of test. For more information, refer to the section on performing system tests in this help. When you restore the implantable device app from the background, the implantable device app attempts to re-establish communication with the implantable device and displays the system status. If the implantable device app was closed, you must interrogate the implantable device to re-establish communication with the implantable device. Electromagnetic interference If electromagnetic interference (EMI) occurs during a telemetry session, EMI can prevent the proper programming or confirmation of values. For more information about EMI, refer to the Medical Procedure and EMI Warnings, Precautions, and Guidance Manual for Health Care Professionals.",
