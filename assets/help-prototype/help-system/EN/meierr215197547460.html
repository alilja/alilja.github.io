         <p class="shortdesc">Use a Read From File session to view saved implantable device data, to save and export
            reports, and to display all programmed parameter values.
         </p>
         <p>To start a Read From File session, end the patient session and refer to the device
            manager app help.

         <div class="note warning"><span class="warningtitle">Warning: </span><p>A Read From File session is designed only for viewing saved implantable device data
               while no patient session is in progress. You cannot program a device or deliver emergency
               therapies from a Read From File session.

         </div>
         <p>A Read From File session presents implantable device data in a slightly different
            way than what is seen during a patient session. Because you are not in a live patient
            session, the Live Rhythm Monitor is replaced with the device model and the words <span class="literal wintitle">Read From File</span>.
         </p>
         <p>When you generate reports during a Read From File session, the retention of those
            reports is the same as the saved implantable device data.
